# Bank-Marketing-ML
A data-driven approach to predict the success of bank telemarketing


A General-to-Specific Statistical Modeling Approach for Bank Telemarketing Success Prediction
*Overview*
> This project aims to predict the success of bank telemarketing campaigns using various statistical modeling techniques.
> I explored feature selection, data preprocessing, and evaluate different classification models.
> The project focuses on both probability output (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks) and class output (e.g., naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors).
